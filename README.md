# KB-open-projects-mega-repo

All my projects completly open for you stranger of the internet!
You might come across projects with image/audio/video files that are blank .txt files. That is because providers like Pixabay and Pexels do not allow redistribution of the illustrations without any changes made to the work. You can find the links to the images in the attribution.txt of every project. Download them and locate the files and it should work properly. Enjoy :)

You are free to use any of my projects for any purposes that aren't commercial ads as long as you credit me and link this repo and the name of the project(s) you used. Using it on Youtube videos or any other form of content is allowed as long as the purpose of the video is not to sell any product.

If you end up using any of my assets please let me know! I would love to see how my work is reused and transformed into new forms.
