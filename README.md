# KB-open-projects-mega-repo

All my projects completly open for you stranger of the internet!
You might come across projects with image/audio/video files that are blank .txt files. That is because providers like Pixabay and Pexels do not allow redistribution of the illustrations without any changes made to the work. You can find the links to the images in the attribution.txt of every project. Download them and locate the files and it should work properly. Enjoy :)
